BIO = After the attack of my town everyone went to relocate. I have would join them but I decide to leave because I want to be a adventurer ever since the day my parents are missing. After 10 days during my journey two cloaked warrior appeared out of out nowhere. I was about to fight them but then they vanish out of thin air and lifted a note saying we know where your parents are hiding at. After reading the message I continue my adventure; during my travels I found some books about these warriors called rangers. They use daggers,swords, and bows to fight meaning they have at a combination of different fighting skills. The second book though I don’t know what it says it seems to be based on Martial arts though I was able to decipher parts of it and it said kick boxing and karate I think. Not sure what the meant but I’ll learn what that means eventually. I’m pretty sure the pictures are self-explanatory so I practice when ever I’m camping. The last book was about weapon skills. Though it  mentioned there are other books like this with different names. Hopefully I  can piece the puzzles of all these books but more importantly find my parents

BIO = My parents left me alone when I was young because they believed that I wasn't gonna be strong enough for anything. I was left with the intention to prove them wrong and become more powerful than them, or even anything if possible. I strive to train as hard as I can and take any challenges or risks that may come my way in order to get stronger. I have gained the interest in using swords and it's sword style used for it, Aincrad. I have also gotten interested in having a fighting style named Jujutsu. My goal is to become as strong as I can no matter how hard it may be and someday see my parents again.

BIO = I was reading a book about these ancient warriors that fought some unknown enemies when I was young. I tried to read the rest of the books however the other books are in a language that I can’t understand. I then went on my quest to find the rest of these books and what they mean. When I was young not only did that book wanna make me go on an adventure but my parents were abusive so I ran and went on my journey but I am determined to find what's out there
