BIO = My parents left me alone when I was young because they believed that I wasn't gonna be strong enough for anything. I was left with the intention to prove them wrong and become more powerful than them, or even anything if possible. I strive to train as hard as I can and take any challenges or risks that may come my way in order to get stronger. I have gained the interest in using swords and it's sword style used for it, Aincrad. I have also gotten interested in having a fighting style named Jujutsu. My goal is to become as strong as I can no matter how hard it may be and someday see my parents again.
